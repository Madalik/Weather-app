In this app, i built a geolocation-based weather app that will show the current weather data depending on the user's location.
There is an image that will change according to the weather. Above is the summary of the weather, the temperature is Celsius, City and Country.
On the right there are displayed the Wind Speed, Pressure, Precipitation and Hummidity. 
You can search for other locations, where you can see all the info above.
